# Refractory-Material-based-data-and-code
This Repository contains the image and absorption spectrum dataset collected against the geometrical input parameters for "Machine-learning-driven accelerated deign-method for Meta-devices".
The code files for both Forward and Inverse models are also shared. 
The file input_data.csv has variation over geometrical parameters.
