# Refractory-Materials-based-data-and-code
The design present in this research work is a unique and robust which covers a wider range of shapes of meta-absorbers made up of different materials. The dataset containing 52,000 samples is collected via commercial EM software i.e., CST Microwave StudioÂ®. This dataset is employed for the forward and inverse design models presented in the work "AI-Driven Rapid Optimization for Nano-Meta-Photonics".

This Repository contains the image and absorption spectrum dataset collected against the geometrical input parameters for "Machine-learning-driven accelerated deign-method for Meta-devices".
The code files for both Forward and Inverse models are also shared. 
The file input_data.csv has variation over geometrical parameters.
The zip file contains rgb images of 3D meta-atoms having various shapes and made of different materials (indicated by the color of the nano-resonator).
